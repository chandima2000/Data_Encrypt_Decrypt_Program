# GNU_Utility
The program is a powerful data encryption and decryption utility designed to provide users with a seamless and secure method for safeguarding sensitive information.
Implemented in C, the program utilizes the Caesar Cipher encryption technique, allowing users to encrypt text files with a customizable shift value to obfuscate the content effectively.
The program's intuitive user interface prompts users to choose between encryption and decryption operations, simplifying the encryption process.
When opting for encryption, users provide the target file for encryption, the desired shift value, and the output file name for the encrypted content. 
Upon successful encryption, the program generates an encrypted version of the input file, rendering the original content indecipherable to unauthorized parties.
In case decryption is preferred, the program takes the encrypted file, along with the same shift value used during encryption, to reverse the encryption process. 
This enables users to effortlessly restore the original content, ensuring seamless access to their data when needed.
By incorporating these encryption and decryption capabilities, the program empowers users to protect their sensitive files from prying eyes, whether they are storing personal information, 
confidential documents, or any data requiring an extra layer of security.
The program's ease of use, robust encryption techniques, and reliable decryption mechanisms make it an invaluable tool for individuals 
and organizations seeking to maintain data privacy and maintain confidentiality in an ever-evolving digital landscape.
For better implementation program is compiled in the GCC compiler.
